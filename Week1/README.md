# Week 1 Overview: Analog Design Internship

Welcome to the Week 1 Overview of the Analog Design Internship! In this week, we focused on designing circuits using the Gm over Id method and gained proficiency in LTspice for circuit analysis and design. We also used LTspice and MS Excel to plot parameter charts using the Gm over Id methodology. One of the main highlights of the week was designing a Common Source Amplifier using the Gm over Id method.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understand the Gm over Id methodology for circuit design.
- Gain proficiency in using LTspice for circuit analysis and design.
- Design a Common Source Amplifier using the Gm over Id method.
- Optimize the W/L ratio for improved performance based on feedback.

## Repository Structure
For Week 1, the directory structure is as follows:

```
- Week 1
  - GmIdMethod
  - Redesigned
  - README.md
```

The `GmIdMethod` directory contains the schematics designed during the week. But there were no constraints in designing . This also include parameter charts for NMOS And PMOS

The `Redesigned` directory includes s the schematics designed during the week but with optimised W/L ratio
## Lecture Resource

To further explore the concept of Gm over Id and enhance your understanding as a beginner, we recommend watching the lecture titled "Gm over Id Demystified" by Professor H. Omran. This lecture provides in-depth insights into the method and its applications in analog circuit design. You can access the lecture using the following link:

Professor H. Omran's lecture is an excellent resource for beginners in analog circuit design, and we highly recommend exploring it to deepen your knowledge.

 Enjoy your learning journey in analog design!
