# Week 3 - Analog Design Internship

Welcome to the Week 3 directory of the Analog Design Internship repository! In this week, we explored the design of various circuits with specific constraints. In the previous weeks, we focused on designing circuits such as the common-source amplifier, current mirror, and differential pair with optimized W/L ratios. However, in Week 3, we introduced a new challenge: designing these circuits using unit devices. 

## Circuit Designs

Throughout Week 3, we successfully designed the following circuits, taking into consideration both the optimized W/L ratio and the use of unit devices:

1. Common Source Amplifier: We designed a common-source amplifier using NMOS and PMOS as the current source load. This design allowed us to achieve a balanced and efficient amplification of the input signal.

2. Differential Pair: We implemented a differential pair circuit that maintained the optimized W/L ratio while utilizing unit devices. 

3. Current Mirror: Another circuit we focused on was the current mirror. By incorporating both the optimized W/L ratio and unit devices, we achieved accurate replication of input current with minimal error.

## Additional Resources

To gain a better understanding of the theory behind these circuits, we highly recommend referring to Bahzad Razavi's lectures on Electronics. Here are the links to his comprehensive lectures:

These lectures provide valuable insights and explanations that complement the practical work we have accomplished in Week 3.
