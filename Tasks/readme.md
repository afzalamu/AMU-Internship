# Analog Design Internship - Tasks

Welcome to the "Tasks" directory of the Analog Design Internship repository! In this directory, you will find all the tasks completed during the internship, including the circuit schematics, simulation results, and the final project. These tasks were accomplished by applying the knowledge and skills acquired from Week 1 to Week 5 of the internship.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Introduction to LTspice and Circuit Simulation Techniques
In this task, we familiarized ourselves with LTspice, a powerful circuit simulation software. We learned various simulation techniques, such as DC sweep, transient analysis, and AC analysis, to characterize and analyze analog circuits.

### Task 1: Design and Simulation of Common Source Amplifier
In this task, we designed and simulated a Common Source Amplifier using an NMOS transistor with a PMOS current source. The amplifier was required to have a gain of 10 at 100 MHz and a Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBW) of 1 GHz.

### Task 2: Design and Simulation of Common Drain Amplifier
The objective of this task was to design and simulate a Common Drain Amplifier with an output impedance of 50 ohms.

### Task 3: Design of Simple Current Mirror
In Task 3, we focused on designing a Simple Current Mirror circuit to generate a reference current (Iref). The reference current was then used to copy the current in another transistor.

### Task 4: CS Amplifier for Design of Differential Pair
For this task, we designed and simulated a Common Source Amplifier to be used as a building block for a Differential Pair circuit. The amplifier needed to have a gain of 10 at 100 MHz and a GBW of 1 GHz.

### Task 5: Design and Simulation of Differential Pair
In Task 5, we designed and simulated a Differential Pair circuit with a gain of 10 at 100 MHz and a GBW of 1 GHz. The Differential Pair circuit plays a crucial role in differential signal processing.

### Task 6: Design and Simulation of Single Stage OPAMP
The objective of Task 6 was to design and simulate a Single Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) with a gain of 10 at 100 MHz and a GBW of 1 GHz. The Single Stage OPAMP is an essential building block in analog systems.

### Final Project: Design and Simulation of Two Stage OPAMP
For the final project of the internship, we successfully designed and simulated a Two Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) with a load capacitance of 20fF and a gain greater than 1000 (60 dB). This project showcased our comprehensive understanding of analog circuit design principles and techniques.

## Applying Week 1 to Week 5 Learnings
Throughout these tasks, we applied the knowledge and skills acquired from Week 1 to Week 5 of the internship. We used the Gm over Id methodology to design the circuits, optimized the W/L ratio for improved performance, and utilized LTspice and ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox) for circuit simulations and analysis. These learning experiences provided us with the necessary foundation to tackle the challenges posed by each task and successfully design the required circuits.
