In this project, the objective is to design a Simple Current Mirror circuit. The current mirror circuit is an essential building block in analog circuit design. It is used to generate a copy of a reference current source. The project aims to achieve accurate current replication and understand the key parameters affecting the performance of the current mirror.

## Project 4: CS Amplifier for Design of Differential Pair

The objective of this project is to design a Common Source (CS) Amplifier for the purpose of building a Differential Pair circuit. The Differential Pair is a fundamental component of many analog circuits, including operational amplifiers and differential amplifiers. The project aims to analyze the performance of the CS amplifier in a differential configuration.

## Project 5: Design and Simulation of Differential Pair

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Differential Pair circuit. The Differential Pair circuit consists of two transistors in a differential configuration and is widely used for its ability to amplify the difference between two input signals. The project aims to analyze the gain, input/output impedance, and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the Differential Pair.

## Project 6: Design and Simulation of Single Stage OPAMP

The objective of this project is to design and simulate a Single Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP). The Single Stage OPAMP is a basic building block for more complex amplifier designs. The project aims to achieve high gain, low input/output impedance, and good frequency response characteristics.

## Project 7: Design and Simulation of Two Stage OPAMP

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Two-Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP). The Two-Stage OPAMP provides higher gain and improved performance compared to the Single Stage OPAMP. The objective is to design an OPAMP with enhanced gain, improved frequency response, and reduced sensitivity to variations in process parameters.
