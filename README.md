# Summer Internship - Analog Circuit Design

This summer internship, organized by the Engineering Design and Implementation Club (Edic) in collaboration with the Department of Electronics Engineering at Aligarh Muslim University, offers an opportunity to learn and explore the field of analog circuit design. Under the mentorship of esteemed professionals, Dr. GS Javed (Technical Team Head @Intel), Professor Syed Atiqur Rahman, and Professor Naushad Alam, interns will gain hands-on experience in designing and simulating various analog circuits.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Introduction to LTspice and Circuit Simulation Techniques

**Objective:** 
Learn LTspice software and circuit simulation techniques through lectures by Professor Baker available at cmosedu.com. Gain proficiency in LTspice for designing and simulating analog circuits.

### Task 1: Design and Simulation of Common Source Amplifier (NMOS + PMOS Current Source)

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Common Source Amplifier using an NMOS transistor with a PMOS current source. The amplifier should have a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBW) of 1GHz.

### Task 2: Design and Simulation of Common Drain Amplifier

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Common Drain Amplifier with an output impedance of 50 ohms.

### Task 3: Design of Simple Current Mirror

**Objective:** 
Design a Simple Current Mirror circuit to generate a reference current (Iref). Then, use the reference current to copy the current in another transistor.

### Task 4: CS Amplifier for Design of Differential Pair

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Common Source Amplifier to be used as a building block for a Differential Pair circuit. The amplifier should have a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a GBW of 1GHz.

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Single Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) with a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a GBW of 1GHz.

### PROJECT: Design and Simulation of Two Stage OPAMP

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Two Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) with a load capacitance of 20fF and a gain greater than 1000 (60 dB).

## Simulation Techniques

Throughout the internship, interns will explore various simulation techniques, including DC sweep, transient analysis, and AC analysis, to characterize and analyze the circuit performance.

## Software Used

For the implementation and simulation of the tasks, the following software tools will be utilized:

- LTspice: LTspice is a widely used circuit simulation software that allows for the analysis and testing of analog and mixed-signal circuits.

- ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox): ADT is a comprehensive software package specifically designed for analog circuit design. It provides advanced simulation and analysis capabilities for complex analog circuits.

We encourage you to make the most of this internship opportunity, develop your skills in analog circuit design, and gain valuable experience in simulation and analysis.
