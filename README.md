# Internship Plan

This internship focuses on designing and simulating various analog circuits using LTspice and ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox) with a specific set of specifications. The design methodology used for all the circuits is the Gm over Id methodology.

## Task 1: Design and Simulation of Common Source Amplifier (NMOS + PMOS Current Source)

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Common Source Amplifier using an NMOS transistor with a PMOS current source. The amplifier should have a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBW) of 1GHz.

## Task 2: Design and Simulation of Common Drain Amplifier

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Common Drain Amplifier with an output impedance of 50 ohms.

## Task 3: Design of Simple Current Mirror

**Objective:** 
Design a Simple Current Mirror circuit to generate a reference current (Iref). Then, use the reference current to copy the current in another transistor.

## Task 4: CS Amplifier for Design of Differential Pair

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Common Source Amplifier to be used as a building block for a Differential Pair circuit. The amplifier should have a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a GBW of 1GHz.

## Task 5: Design and Simulation of Differential Pair

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Differential Pair circuit with a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a GBW of 1GHz.

## Task 6: Design and Simulation of Single Stage OPAMP

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Single Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) with a gain of 10 at 100MHz and a GBW of 1GHz.

## Final Project: Design and Simulation of Two Stage OPAMP

**Objective:** 
Design and simulate a Two Stage Operational Amplifier (OPAMP) with a load capacitance of 20fF and a gain greater than 1000 (60 dB).

**Note:** 
All the projects will be implemented using the Gm over Id methodology.

## Software Used

For the implementation and simulation of the projects, the following software tools will be utilized:

- LTspice: LTspice is a widely used circuit simulation software that allows for the analysis and testing of analog and mixed-signal circuits.

- ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox): ADT is a comprehensive software package specifically designed for analog circuit design. It provides advanced simulation and analysis capabilities for complex analog circuits.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the projects. Happy designing and simulating!
