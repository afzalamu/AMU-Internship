 # Analog Design Internship - Week 5 Overview

Welcome to the Week 5 overview of the Analog Design Internship! In this week, we made significant progress in designing various analog circuits using advanced tools and techniques. Let's dive into the details of the work accomplished during this week.

## Previous Method: LT SPICE and Gm over Id Method
In the earlier stages of the internship, we utilized LT SPICE, a popular circuit simulation tool, to extract the NMOS and PMOS parameter charts required for circuit design. The Gm over Id Method was employed to analyze and characterize these devices.

## Introduction of ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox)
In Week 5, we introduced a new tool called ADT (Analog Designer Toolbox). ADT is a powerful software that comes with pregenerated lookup tables specifically tailored for the 180nm technology. By using the provided CMOS180.txt model file, ADT allows us to plot various parameter charts for NMOS and PMOS devices, considering different specifications such as length, VDS, VSB, and more.

## Designed Circuits
With the aid of ADT and LT SPICE, we successfully designed the following circuits during Week 5:

1. **Common-Source (CS) Amplifier**: This circuit was implemented using both NMOS and PMOS devices to create a versatile amplifier.

2. **Common-Drain Amplifier**: Also known as a source follower, this circuit was designed to achieve specific voltage gain characteristics.

3. **Simple Current Mirror**: A basic current mirror circuit was created, which is a fundamental component in analog circuitry.

4. **CS Amplifier for Designing Differential Pair**: A CS amplifier was tailored specifically for designing a differential pair, a crucial circuit configuration for differential signal processing.

5. **Differential Pair**: This circuit, consisting of two complementary transistors, forms the basis for differential amplifiers and operational amplifiers.

6. **Single-Stage Operational Amplifier**: An essential building block in analog systems, a single-stage op-amp was designed with careful consideration of gain and stability.

7. **Two-Stage Operational Amplifier (Final Project)**: Using the knowledge gained from the previous circuits, we successfully designed a two-stage op-amp with a gain exceeding 60 dB. This accomplishment marked the completion of all the given internship tasks.

## ADT Download Link and License
To access ADT and benefit from its features, please visit the official ADT website at [https://adt.master-micro.com/](https://adt.master-micro.com/). As an intern, you can obtain a one-year license by using your college email ID, granting you ample time to explore and utilize the tool for your analog design projects.
