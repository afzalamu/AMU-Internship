 # Week 4 - Analog Design Internship

Welcome to the Week 4 directory of the Analog Design Internship repository! In this week, we continued our exploration of circuit design, focusing on the development of operational amplifiers (op-amps) with specific specifications. Building upon the concepts and constraints from previous weeks, we successfully designed single-stage and two-stage op-amps to meet specific performance requirements.

## Circuit Designs

During Week 4, we accomplished the following op-amp designs while considering the given constraints:

1. Single-Stage Op-Amp: Our task was to design a single-stage op-amp with a gain of 10 at 100 MHz and a gain-bandwidth product (GBW) of 1 GHz. By carefully optimizing the circuit's architecture, transistor sizing, and compensation techniques, we achieved a single-stage op-amp that met these specifications.

2. Two-Stage Op-Amp: In this challenge, our goal was to design a two-stage op-amp with a gain greater than 1000 (60 dB). 

These op-amp designs represent important building blocks in analog circuitry, and their successful implementation showcases our ability to meet demanding specifications while considering design constraints.

## Additional Resources
