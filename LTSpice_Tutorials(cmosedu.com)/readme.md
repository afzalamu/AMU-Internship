# LTspice and Circuit Simulation Techniques

This repository serves as a resource for learning LTspice software and circuit simulation techniques through lectures by Professor Baker available at cmosedu.com. The objective is to gain proficiency in LTspice for designing and simulating analog circuits.

## Lectures

The lectures can be accessed at [cmosedu.com](https://cmosedu.com/videos/ee220D/ee220D.htm). The lectures cover the following topics:

1. **Lecture 1**: Download and install LTspice, Ohm's law, using LTspice to do .op (operating point), .tran (transient), and .dc (DC sweep) sims.
2. **Lecture 2**: Some more basic circuit examples using Ohm's law, voltage dividers, Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).
3. **Lecture 3**: More circuit examples, current source, two loops, voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).
4. **Lecture 4**: Linear circuit examples using two loops with voltage sources and current sources.
5. **Lecture 5**: Examples using dependent sources. Work examples from linear circuits book.
6. **Lecture 6**: Modeling the ideal op-amp using a VCVS. Deriving the gain of the non-inverting and inverting op-amp circuits.

Additional simulation examples, including an inverter and ring oscillator, can be found at [cmosedu.com](https://cmosedu.com/videos/ltspice/ltspice_videos.htm).

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Download and install LTspice from the [official website](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
2. Watch the lectures in the specified order to learn various circuit simulation techniques.
3. Explore the circuit schematics designed in the lectures to gain practical understanding.
4. Refer to the additional lectures on simulation and specific circuit examples for further practice and learning.

By following this repository and engaging with the lectures, you will be able to develop proficiency in using LTspice for analog circuit design and simulation.

Happy learning and designing!
