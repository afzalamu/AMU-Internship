# Week 2 Overview: Analog Design Internship

Welcome to Week 2 of the Analog Design Internship! In this week, we will continue our exploration of circuit design with a focus on optimizing the W/L ratio using the Gm over Id method. We will design and analyze several important circuits, including the Common Source Amplifier, Common Drain Amplifier, Simple Current Mirror, and Differential Pair. 

## Key Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of optimizing the W/L ratio in circuit design.
- Familiarize yourself with the Gm over Id method and its applications.
- Design and analyze the Common Source Amplifier using the Gm over Id method.
- Explore the design of the Common Drain Amplifier using optimized W/L ratios.
- Understand the principles behind the Simple Current Mirror and optimize its performance.
- Design and analyze the Differential Pair circuit using the Gm over Id method.

## Technology Node

For the circuits designed in this internship, we have used a technology node of 180 nm. This choice of technology node affects the design considerations and parameters of the circuits. However, the principles and methodologies discussed can be applied to different technology nodes with appropriate adjustments.

## Lecture Resource

To supplement your understanding of the concepts covered in Week 2, we recommend referring to the lecture series by Dr. GS Javed sir.  You can access the playlist using the following link:
